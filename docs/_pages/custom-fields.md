Voyzu allows you to maintain a central list of custom fields that are common to all your shared contacts.  If you add a new custom field then all contacts will have this custom field added as a blank custom field, if you change the name of a custom field, then the field will be renamed for all contacts, and if you delete a custom field then the field data will be deleted for all contacts.

So you can easily distinguish Voyzu shared custom fields from other custom fields, custom fields in Voyzu always start with the hash (`#`) character.
