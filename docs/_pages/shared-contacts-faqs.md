Frequently asked questions about how Voyzu contact sharing works

## The FAQs

###### How does contact sharing work in Voyzu?
Voyzu contacts are automatically downloaded into a special `#voyzu shared` folder within Google contacts. Synchronization is one way - changes you make within Voyzu are automatically applied to users' Google contacts. Changes users make within Google contacts are not synchronized.

###### Are contacts that don't have #voyzu shared label ever shared with other users?
No. Your private contacts remain private and are never shared with other users. Only contacts you choose to share (i.e. those with the `#voyzu shared` label) are shared

###### Can I share contacts with users outside my Google Workspace domain?
No. Voyzu Shared Contacts for Google Workspace has been purpose designed to allow companies and organizations to maintain a global list of organization-wide contacts.

###### Can I control which users have access to the `#voyzu shared` label?
You can, as a domain administrator. Log in to Voyzu and navigate to the 'Users' menu. From there you can search for users and select which users you want to give access to company shared contacts

###### How do I import contacts into my Voyzu Shared Contacts?
You can import Google contacts into Voyzu via the "Import Contacts" feature, see [the import contacts help](../import-contacts/) for more on this.

###### When I add a new user to my Google Workspace domain, will they automatically get access to shared contacts?
Yes - this is the default. You can change this setting by logging into Voyzu and clicking the 'Settings' cog.  See [the settings help](../settings/) for more on this.

###### Can I apply other labels to shared contacts in addition to the `#voyzu shared` label?
Currently voyzu does not have the ability to share labels, this feature is currently under development.

###### Is there a limit to the number of users I can share contacts with across my Google Workspace domain?
Yes there is a limit of 50 users participating in contacts sharing. If you want to share across more than 50 users then [contact us](https://voyzu.com/contact.html) to learn more about our higher volume plans

###### Is there a limit to the number of shared contacts I can have?
For free edition customers the limit is 30 contacts. For customers with a subscription there is a limit of 10,000 shared contacts. If you want to share over 10,000 contacts then [contact us](https://voyzu.com/contact.html)  to learn more about our higher volume plans

###### Are changes I make to my shared contacts in Google contacts automatically synchronized?
No, syncronization is one way. The change you make in Google contacts will be discarded the next time this contact is changed in Voyzu.
